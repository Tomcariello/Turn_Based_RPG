# Turn_Based_RPG
V0.1a

I will be creating a fighting engine inspired by Final Fantasy II for the SNES. The motivation for this project is to further develop my programming skills in javascript and continue to learn.

User Experience:
  Select their player(s)
  Equip their player(s)
  Select the enemy(s) they would like to fight (or accept random enemy)
  Select items they want/need for the fight
  Once that fight is over the user can begin again by selecting their settings

What this will not do:
  Save states
  Allow users to fight each other
  Be a full RPG experience; there will be no exploration or character development


Goals:
V0.1 - Proof of concept
Single player controlled character vs single enemy
No user configuration of player
"Attack" will be the only option (but a menu will exist)
Time will be accounted for in true Turn Based fashion

V0.2
Addition of weapon/armor configuration for user

V0.3
Animation for character

V0.4
Multiple player controllable characters


Stretch Goals:
Each character will have different abilities
Multiple Enemies to fight
Ability to fight more than 1 enemy at a time
Magic
Player on left/right center
Player party seperated (multiple fights)
